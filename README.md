This repository contains the [`edu.cnm.deepdive.android.DateTimePickerFragment`](docs/api/edu/cnm/deepdive/android/DateTimePickerFragment.html) utility class, along with a supporting `enum` and `interface`, intended to simplify the use of the Android [DatePicker](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/DatePicker.html) and [TimePicker](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TimePicker.html) in application code.
(The need for the other classes &amp; interfaces originally included in this library has been obviated by the use of libraries such as ReactiveX.) 

For more information, see the [Javadoc](docs/api/).
